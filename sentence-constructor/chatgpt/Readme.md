## ChatGPT Powered Assitant Guide

### The Model ChatGPT 4o Plus

GPT 4o

I will be using the paid version of ChatGPT - Plus.  This version is fast enough, plus I don't want to use the o1 reasoning models because they have limit use per day and from my expierence 4o provides me better answers than the other reasoning models.

## Prompting Guides

Just like Meta AI there are no specific formatting to best provide context.


### **Hypothesis**  
We hypothesize that a GenAI-powered teaching assistant can effectively guide students in translating English sentences into Spanish by providing hints, feedback, and structured learning paths rather than direct translations. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning techniques, the assistant will encourage active learning, helping users build language comprehension and retention over time.

### **Technical Uncertainty**  
The key uncertainties in this project revolve around how well the AI can:  
1. **Balance Guidance vs. Direct Answers** – Ensuring the AI provides meaningful hints without giving away full translations is a challenge. Fine-tuning the level of assistance will require testing different reinforcement learning strategies and prompt engineering approaches.  
2. **Contextual Accuracy** – Spanish translations often depend on grammatical context, regional variations, and idiomatic usage. Ensuring that the AI can recognize nuances in sentence structure and meaning is an open challenge.  
3. **User Adaptability** – The AI should adapt to different proficiency levels, recognizing when a user needs more support versus when they can be challenged. Implementing dynamic difficulty adjustment will require testing different models and datasets.  
4. **Handling Edge Cases** – Ambiguous sentences, slang, or complex grammar structures may cause unpredictable AI behavior. The model must be stress-tested with diverse examples to refine accuracy and reliability.  
5. **Real-Time Feedback & Interactivity** – The AI must provide responsive and interactive feedback in a way that enhances the learning experience. Exploring the best way to integrate explanations and interactive examples without overwhelming users is a technical challenge.  

### **Technical Exploration**  
To address these uncertainties, our approach will involve:  
1. **Prototyping with LLMs** – Testing different large language models (e.g., GPT-4, open-source models like Llama) to evaluate their effectiveness in guiding translations.  
2. **Fine-Tuning & Prompt Engineering** – Experimenting with structured prompts and reinforcement learning techniques to ensure that the assistant provides guidance rather than direct answers.  
3. **Dataset Curation** – Collecting and refining a diverse dataset of English-Spanish sentence pairs with contextual explanations to improve model accuracy.  
4. **Adaptive Learning Implementation** – Developing mechanisms to assess a user’s proficiency and dynamically adjust feedback complexity.  
5. **Edge Case Analysis** – Identifying common failure points through user testing and refining model responses accordingly.  
6. **User Experience & Interaction Design** – Building an interface that makes interactions intuitive, engaging, and conducive to active learning.
