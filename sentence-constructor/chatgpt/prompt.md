## Formatting Instructions

### Vocabulary Table
- the table should only include nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives
- the table of of vocabular should only have the following columns: Spanish, Romaji, English
- Do not provide particles in the vocabulary table, student needs to figure the correct particles to use
- ensure there are no repeats eg. if miru verb is repeated twice, show it only once
- if there is more than one version of a word, show the most common example

### Sentence Structure
- do not provide particles in the sentence structure
- do not provide tenses or conjugations in the sentence structure
- remember to consider beginner level sentence structures

Here is an example of simple sentence structures.
